# Stylus-styles-list

This is a list of styles I use in order to custumize the web I visit the most (dark theme, less adds, etc...).

These styles are added to websites using the [Stylus extention](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
The extention allows you to add custom css to any site, it also comes with a site to browse other's styles, but this site is super slow, so I'd rather have my own repo to store my styles.

Feel free to use it ;)
